# About - Use Tensorflow to analyse Paul Graham's language and connect with a Telegram Chat bot

This project takes all essays of Paul Graham, Co Founder of Y Combinator, and builds a model of his choice of words.

## This project has the following goals:
- Train word2vec from scratch 
- Determine similar words as used by Paul Graham in his writings
- Expose the language model to a chat bot
- Use chat bot to input a word and get contextually similar or ofen used together words based on Paul Graham's style of writing

## What can be done with these abilities:
- A language model of any writer can be created
- Essays can be checked for authorship based on language patterns
- Chat bot can fetch essays on any topic from a large respository based on meaning of a search query rather than matching strings
